# Computer Vision with YOLO 
This repository was built to create yolo from scrach and do experiments on how yolo works, if you want to learn how to use all yolo models, go to YOLO repository.
You Only Look Once

In this repository, we are going to build several object detection projects with YOLO algorithm.
The Goal here is to learn how yolo works and how to Implement it, 
so we are going to write this algorithms, from scratch.

You can access YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement article, here; https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767

And also, you can learn about in this awesome website; https://pylessons.com/YOLOv3-introduction

And In this Repository, you will learn how to Implement and use each yolo algorithm.
