# Computer Vision with YOLO
You Only Look Once

In this repository, we are going to build several object detection projects with YOLO algorithm.
The Goal here is to learn how yolo works and how to Implement it in Pytorch and Tensorflow, 
so we are going to write this algorithms, from scratch.

You can access YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement article, here; https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767

And also, you can learn
